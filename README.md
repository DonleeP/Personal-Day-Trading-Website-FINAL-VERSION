# Personal-Day-Trading-Website-FINAL-VERSION
A website about my knowledge of day-trading that includes my progress as well as information I know about and list them. Final version for school assignment. This is the FINAL VERSION of the project for submission. I plan on continuing this project but for the school assignment this will be the final submission. The FINAL VERSION includes all stratagies as well as a fully finished resources page and a little addition to the "about me" tab I included a link which leads to my funded trader certification from TopStep.
